### Summary

Let me introduce myself, I go by name Arslan, but you can call me your future employee.

My goal is to become a highly qualified professional in web and game development.

I used to love playing the guitar, graduated from music school. I was in a musical group for about a year. After that I got interested in web development. graduated from Proweb's front-end developer course.

My experience in web development is over 2 years.

Now in my free time I like to read books in the genre of fantasy and sometimes play the guitar. I am also looking for a job in web development, which I can combine with my university studies
